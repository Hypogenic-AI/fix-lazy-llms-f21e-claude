The question asks: What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?\n\nFirst, let's identify which lumber is cheaper per stick.\n\n- Cost per stick for 2 x 4:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{4 \\text{ dollars}}{200 \\text{ sticks}} = 0.02 \\text{ dollars per stick}\n  \\]\n\n- Cost per stick for 2 x 8:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{6 \\text{ dollars}}{400 \\text{ sticks}} = 0.015 \\text{ dollars per stick}\n  \\]\n\nThe 2 x 8 lumber is cheaper per stick ($0.015 < $0.02).\n\nHowever, the problem says \"if he buys the cheapest lumber,\" which could mean he only buys the lumber type that costs less per piece, or it could mean he only buys the lumber that is cheaper per stick.\n\nLet's consider both interpretations:\n\n### Interpretation 1: He buys only the lumber that costs less per piece (cheapest lumber per piece)\n\n- 2 x 4 costs $4 per piece\n- 2 x 8 costs $6 per piece\n\nThe cheapest lumber per piece is 2 x 4.\n\nHe has $24, so he can buy:\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{4} = 6 \\text{ pieces of 2 x 4}\n\\]\n\nEach piece yields 200 sticks, so total sticks:\n\\[\n6 \\times 200 = 1200 \\text{ sticks}\n\\]\n\n### Interpretation 2: He buys only the lumber that is cheapest per stick\n\nThe 2 x 8 is cheaper per stick, so he buys only 2 x 8 pieces.\n\nHe has $24, so he can buy:\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{6} = 4 \\text{ pieces of 2 x 8}\n\\]\n\nEach piece yields 400 sticks, so total sticks:\n\\[\n4 \\times 400 = 1600 \\text{ sticks}\n\\]\n\nSince the problem says \"if he buys the cheapest lumber,\" the most reasonable interpretation is that he buys the lumber that is cheapest per piece, which is 2 x 4.\n\nTherefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber (2 x 4) is 1200 sticks.\n\n### Final answer:\n#### 1200",

Each necklace has 8 topaz gemstones, each 1 inch long, and sterling silver beads between the gemstones. Each bead is 0.25 inches long. We need to find how many sterling silver beads are used per necklace.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones  \nEach topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 gemstones:  \nTotal length of gemstones = 8 \u00d7 1 inch = 8 inches\n\nStep 3: Calculate the remaining length for the sterling silver beads  \nTotal necklace length = 25 inches  \nLength taken by gemstones = 8 inches  \nRemaining length for beads = 25 - 8 = 17 inches\n\nStep 4: Determine the number of beads and their length  \nThe beads fill the spaces between the gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, the number of spaces between them is one less than the number of gemstones:  \nNumber of spaces = 8 - 1 = 7\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total length of beads if there are 7 beads  \nEach bead is 0.25 inches long, so 7 beads would be:  \n7 \u00d7 0.25 = 1.75 inches\n\nStep 6: Check if the beads fill the remaining length  \nRemaining length for beads is 17 inches, but 7 beads only make 1.75 inches. This means there must be more beads than just 7.\n\nStep 7: Reconsider the problem  \nThe problem states that the beads fill the space between gemstones, but it does not say there is only one bead per space. There can be multiple beads between gemstones.\n\nStep 8: Calculate the total number of beads needed to fill 17 inches  \nEach bead is 0.25 inches, so the number of beads needed to fill 17 inches is:  \nNumber of beads = 17 \u00f7 0.25 = 68 beads\n\nStep 9: Final answer  \nKaterina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.\n\n#### 68",
